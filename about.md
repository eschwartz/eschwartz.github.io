# About me

I am a web developer based out of Minneapolis, MN. I spend a lot of time team deep in Javascript code, though I dabble in PHP from time to time.

I code because I like solving puzzles. I believe code should be beautiful, poetic, and meaningful.

Currently, I'm working as the lead developer an open-source weather mapping library called [Aeris.js](https://github.com/hamweather/aerisjs).
