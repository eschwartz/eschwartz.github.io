# About me

I am a web developer based out of Minneapolis, MN. I currently work at a [AerisWeather](http://aerisweather.com/) building data ingestion pipelines, and web APIs, and generally trying to keep things running smoothly.

I code because I like solving puzzles. I believe code should be beautiful, articulate, and meaningful.

Currently, I'm working on expanding the list of data sets available from the [Aeris Maps Platform](https://www.aerisweather.com/develop/#maps), and setting up monitoring systems to improve the platform's uptime and performance.
