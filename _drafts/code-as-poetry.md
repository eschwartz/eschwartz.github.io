Imagine you had to write a book about the history of the USA, covering the last hundred years.

But you had to right it in such a way that you could publish new versions of the book every year, with everything new that happened over the last year, and every new perspective and analysis of past events. And imagine that you had to do this for 10, 20, 30 years. And, the book needed to be readable to any layman over the age of 15. And with a 500 page limit.

Now imagine that every week, the book needed to be modified to describe the history of another country in the world.

To do all this, you would need something more powerful than the English language. You would need code.

Beautiful code can accomplish this kind of task. It can describe incredibly complex systems with clarity. It can create sentences that describe large concepts with simplicity from a distance, but with incredible detail up close. Code can do this because, when it's good, it does not need to describe how things happen. Instead it creates structures of meaning, which act as scaffolds beneath surface details. Because of its ability to do that, we can swap out one set of facts for another, and create entirely new stories, which maintains their own truths.

I think some day soon, the greatest artists will draw poems in code. Imagine the possibilities! Ideas, moods, and theologies can be iterated, composed, instantiated, and applied across any number of scenes and canvases. Imagine the rendering strategies! You could log each statement, and use reflection to describe the process. You could assign colors to primitives, and draw a canvas of pixels for each value invoked. You could build your own IDE, to bring you any kind of journey through the code. The code code could create its own user interface, or APIs for other art to ingest. And on every level, the code itself can be poetry.
