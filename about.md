# About me

I am a web developer based out of Minneapolis, MN. I currently work at a [weather data company](http://aerisweather.com/) building web apps, APIs, and data processing services.

I code because I like solving puzzles. I believe code should be beautiful, poetic, and meaningful.

Currently, I'm working as the lead developer an open-source weather mapping library called [Aeris.js](https://github.com/hamweather/aerisjs).

You can find my contact info on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/eschwartz);
